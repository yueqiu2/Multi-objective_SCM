# Evolutionary Algorithms in Reinforcement Learning - Multi-objective Optimization in Inventory Management
### Project
- Motivation: Strike a balance between financial gains and transporation environmental impact of supply chain operations
- Goal: Identify the trade-off solutions (Pareto front)

- Apply reinforcement learning framework
- Use multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) to optimize the policy net
- The MOEAs are: (1) NSGA-II (classic!), (2) AGE-MOEA (state-of-the-art).
- Use Bayesian optimization to smart tune hyperparameters of the MOEAs
